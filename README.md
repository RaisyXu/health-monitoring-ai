# AI-Driven Health Monitoring System

This project builds a machine learning and generative AI system that predicts health risk levels and provides personalized health advice based on heart rate, activity level, and age.

## Features
- Predict health risk using RandomForestClassifier
- Generate personalized advice using OpenAI GPT-3.5
- Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and OpenAI API

## Files
- `Build_AI_Health_Monitoring_System.ipynb` — Main project notebook
- `health_data.csv` — Sample dataset for training/testing

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
    ```
    pip install pandas scikit-learn openai
    ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key inside the notebook.
3. Run the notebook.
